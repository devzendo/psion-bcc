The file genlib.tbl is a table of EPOC system calls. Each line has the
following form:

IoOpen			85,00		bx,cx,dx	ax

There are four fields separated by one or more TABs.

The first field is the function name.

The second field is the interrupt number followed optionally by a comma and
the sub function number, both in HEX without leading 0x or $.

The third field is a comma separated list of registers. The order is the
order in which a C function call will use them. For example IoOpen(1,2,3)
would set bx to 1, cx to 2 and dx to 3.

The fourth field is the register containing any return value. If left blank
ax is assumed.  If the carry is set (which EPOC uses to indicate an error)
the ax is returned regardless (an error code is sent in ax). If the carry is
clear then the specified register is returned.

The awk script then produces a set of file called epocxxyy.s where xx and yy
are the interrupt and sub function numbers respectively.
