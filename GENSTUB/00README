The genstub script and documentaion was provided by Stephen Henson. 
Thanks, Steve!

His original genlib.tbl file is included here as genlib.tbl.orig.

The large genlib.tbl has been taken from freely available sources, and 
hacked into the form you see here by MJG :)

Feel free to go through it with a fine-toothed comb...
