It appears that a 386 version of the syscall libs is also wanted ...

SYSV IPC, there's and __ipc syscall and the hardware can manage messages and
semaphores.

Idea, for RPC syscall, seperate all the FD related calls from the system ones
IIRC all the single FD related ones have the FD in arg0
