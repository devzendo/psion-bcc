This is a filter that sits in between the C preprocessor and the next C
compiler stage, and that on the fly rewrites ANSI C to old C. Its
primary application is to compile ANSI C software in UNIX environments
that do not (yet) have an ANSI C compiler and that cannot run GCC
because of technical or political problems.

Problems solved with this release:

Minor: the program was originally intended for the compilation of
already tested ANSI C source, so that diagnostics from the native C
compiler would be sufficient. The present release produces better
diagnostics, so that it can also be used for program development.

Major: the template Makefile suggested that all #pragma directives be
filtered out. This turns out to be a bad idea because some non-ANSI
compilers (SunOS) rely on #pragmas to correctly handle the unusual flow
control caused by vfork(2), setjmp(3) etcetera. A warning to this
effect has been added to the Makefile.

No changes were made to the actual filter logic; output should be
identical to that of the previous release.
