/somewhere/cpp ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
This document describes a filter that sits between the
C preprocessor (usually \fI/lib/cpp\fP) and the next C compiler
pass. It rewrites ANSI-C style function headers, function type
declarations, function pointer types, and function pointer casts
to old style. Other ANSI-isms are passed on without modification
(token pasting, pragmas, etcetera).

For maximal flexibility, the "cpp | unproto" pipeline can  be
packaged as an executable shell script named "/somewhere/cpp".
This script should then be specified to the C compiler as a
non-default preprocessor.

The overhead of shell script interpretation can be avoided by
having the unprototyper itself open the pipe to the preprocessor.
In that case, the source should be compiled with the PIPE_THROUGH_CPP
macro defined (usually as "/lib/cpp"), and the resulting binary
should be installed as "/somewhere/cpp".

cc(1), how to specify a non-default C preprocessor.

Some versions of the lint command are implemented as a shell
script. It should require only minor modification for integration
with the unprotoizer. Other versions of the lint command accept the same
command syntax as the C compiler for the specification of a non-default
preprocessor. Some research may be needed.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
The progam will complain if it unexpectedly
reaches the end of input.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
Should be run on preprocessed source only, i.e. after macro expansion.

Declarations of (whatever) are misunderstood and will result in
syntax errors.

Does not generate explicit type casts for function argument
expressions.
