nullprog is the null program. Used to test that things
work as they should.

mtest is the null program built by Tore Lund using the
SIBO C SDK. Thanks, Tore!

Look at the testcompiler script to see how I built the
test program nicprog.c

hello.img is a "Hello World!" program built with SmallC
on the Psion.
