This is a program that does nothing.

It's used for my startup code investigations. 
Build it with:
bcc nullprog.c -o nullprog.img

A version compiled by the SIBO C SDK is in ../mtest 

The .img file will have the .pic, .rsc and .shd files embedded in it,
according to the .afl file. The .pic file was taken from the SPY example
in the SIBO SDK, if you were wondering :)
